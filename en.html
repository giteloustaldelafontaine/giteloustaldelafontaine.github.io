Located in the heart of the village of Mostuéjouls, at the entrance to the Tarn Gorges, just 25 minutes from Millau and its Viaduct, with panoramic views, L'Oustal de la Fontaine is the former village presbytery, a spacious character stone house fully restored with all modern comforts. You will enjoy the peace and quiet of this typical village, hiking opportunities in spectacular landscapes, and the crystal-clear waters of the Tarn River below the village.
